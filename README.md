## Exceptions and Try/Catch Practice: Address Book

https://github.com/nashville-software-school/bangazon-inc/blob/master/book-1-orientation/chapters/TRY_CATCH_INTRO.md

1. Create a new console application.
2. Replace the default `Program` class with the code in the link above.
3. Add the required classes to make the code compile.
HINT: Use a Dictionary in the `AddressBook` class to store `Contacts`. The key should be the contact's email address.

4. Run the program and observe the exception.
5. Add try/catch blocks in the appropriate locations to prevent the program from crashing. Print meaningful error messages in the catch blocks.
